## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

To run this project, you need to set up the environment variables. Follow these steps to configure them:

1. **Copy the example file**: Start by creating a copy of the `.env.example` file. You can do this by running:
   `cp .env.example .env`
   This command creates a new file named `.env` with the same contents as `.env.example`.

2. **Edit the `.env` file**: Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor. You'll see various placeholders for configuration values. Replace these placeholders with your actual configuration values. For example:
   - **your_username**: Your MongoDB username.
   - **your_password**: Your MongoDB password.
   - **your_cluster_url**: Your MongoDB cluster URL.
   - **your_database_name**: The name of your MongoDB database.
   - **your_jwt_secret**: A secret key for JWT.
   - **your_jwt_expiration**: Expiration time for JWT.
   - **your_aws_access_key_id**: Your AWS Access Key ID.
   - **your_aws_secret_access_key**: Your AWS Secret Access Key.
   - **your_aws_default_region**: Your default AWS region.
   - **your_aws_bucket_name**: The name of your AWS bucket.
3. **Save the `.env` file**: After replacing all the placeholders with your actual values, save the file.
4. **Restart the server**: If your server was running, restart it to apply the new environment variables.

**Remember not to commit the `.env` file to your version control system. It contains sensitive information specific to your environment.**
